Local Version Control System
----------------------------
 > A local version Control System is a local database located on your local computer, in which every file change 
   is stored as a patch

Centralized Version Control System
---------------------------------- 
 > Centralized Version Control System contain just one repository globally and every user need to commit for reflecting
   One's changes in the repository. It is possible for others to see you changes by updating e.g SVN

Distributed Version Control System
----------------------------------
 > Distributed Version Control Systems contain multiple repositories. Each user has their own repository and working copy
   just committing your changes will not give others access to your changes. This is because commit will reflect those changes in your local repository and you need to push them in order to make them visible on the central repository.
   Similarly, when you update, you do not get other changes, unless you have first pulled those changes into your repository.   
   
 > To make your changes visible to others, four things are required
          You commit
          You push
          They pull
          They update

 > The most popular version control systems are Git and Mercurial
