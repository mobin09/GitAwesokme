1.Git Introduction
-----------------
 > Git is a popular version control system (VCS)
 > It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and it is maintained by Junio Hamano
 

Git is used for
---------------
 > Tracking code changes.
 > Tracking who made the changes like history of files.
 > Coding collabarations.
 
Types of Version Control System
-------------------------------
 > Local Version Control System.
 > Centralized Version Control System.
 > Distributed Version Control System.
 
Local Version Control System
----------------------------
 > A local version Control System is a local database located on your local computer, in which every file change 
   is stored as a patch

Centralized Version Control System
---------------------------------- 
 > Centralized Version Control System contain just one repository globally and every user need to commit for reflecting
   One's changes in the repository. It is possible for others to see you changes by updating e.g SVN

Distributed Version Control System
----------------------------------
 > Distributed Version Control Systems contain multiple repositories. Each user has their own repository
   and working copy just committing your changes will not give others access to your changes.
   This is because commit will reflect those changes in your local repository and you need to push 
   them in order to make them visible on the central repository.
   Similarly, when you update, you do not get other changes, unless you have
   first pulled those changes into your repository.   
   
 > To make your changes visible to others, four things are required
          You commit
          You push
          They pull
          They update

 > The most popular version control systems are Git and Mercurial
		  
There are two types of Git Software
-----------------------------------
        1. Git Server
		2. Git Client
		   
Git Server
----------
 > It is a repository.
 > It is the largest host of the source code.
 > It is used to mannage/store the source code of the project. 
 > Some of the Git server tools are:- Githhub, BitBucket, GitLab etc.
 
Git Client
----------
 > It is a tool which is used to connect to our Git server.
   e.g     > Git bash -- Linux command are required
           > Git gui  -- GUI through clicks
		   > Git cmd  -- command line tools

How git Works
------------
 > Compared to other VCS like subversions. Most operations in Git requires local files and local 
   resources to operate. 
 > If you are used to CVCS where most operations have that network latency overhead.

Architecture of Git (Three stages in Git)
--------------------
                        add                    commit                       push
	  |Working Area ----------> Staging Area ----------> Local Repository |-----------> Git Server
	  
	  To understant it better see pics of Architecture of Git.
	  
	  Once the code in staging area, we commit it to the local repository with some standard message,
	  from local repository we push it to remote repository by providing url, username and password
	  
Workign Directory (Working Area)
--------------------------------
 > The working area is a single checkout of one version of the project.
   These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git
   directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
   
Stagin Area
-----------
 > The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory,
   that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its
   technical name is the "Index", but the phrase "Staging area" works just as well.   

Local Repository (Repository Area)(.git)
----------------------------------
 > The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project.
   This is the most important part of Git, and it is what  is copied when you clone a repository
   from another computer.
   
Installing GIT
--------------
 > Install latest version of git from its official sites
 > git --version (TO check Git is installed or not)
 
There are a lot of different ways to use git
-------------------------------------------
 > Using Command Line Tools (Recommended)
 > Using Graphical User Interfaces 
 
 Git Configuration
 ------------------
 > After installing Git in our system.
 > The first thing we need to do is set our username and the email address.
 > This is because when we use git to change the files in the project.
   Git uses the information to identify who has made the changes to the file. 
 > The command to add username and password is:
        git config
        git config --list (to see list for configuration)
		git config --global user.email "myemail@gmail.com"
		git config --global user.name "Mobin Arshad"
		
 > There are three levels of configuration in Git: 
   System Level (Git Installation) {/usr/local/etc/gitconfig}
   Global Level (User Account) {Users/mobin/.gitconfig}
   Local level  (Repository / Project level) {repository/.git/config} {Project Level}
         > git config --local user.email "mobin@abc.com"
		 > git config --local user.name "Mobin Arshad"
		 
  To check :
         > git config user.email  
   
 > Check Complete Git config
   git config --list --show-origin  (Show location where it present and it's config)
 > Remove a specific setting for a specific level of config
   git config --global --unset user.name
 > Remove the specific section
   git config --global --remove-section user {remove all section}
   
  
Creating a Git repository
-------------------------  
 > mkdir directory-name
 > git init
 > git status
 
Initializing and creating directory at the same time
----------------------------------------------------
 > git init newProjectDirectory 
   
git help / git --help  and status command
---------------------------   
 > git help -a (To see all git commands)  {note--> q to quit}
 > git help init (to check the init command)
 > git help add 
 
 > git status (check the status
 
git add and git commit
----------------------
 > git add <file> -- To update what will be commited --workign area to staging area -- untracked to tracked file
   git add .      -- Move all files from working area to staging area -- untracked to tracked file
   
 > git commit -m "message"
